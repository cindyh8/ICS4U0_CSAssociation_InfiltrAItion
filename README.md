# InfiltrAItion

## Description

**InfiltrAItion** is a Java-based interactive game designed to help players, especially those aged 8 to 16, explore and understand the challenges and advantages of living in a future world ruled by Artificial Intelligence.

Built using **Java Swing**, the game features animated levels, interactive UI elements, score tracking, and a highscore system saved to a file.

### Storyline

It is the year **2135**. The world is dominated by AI robots capable of self-learning and mutation. You play as a **human security officer** recently hired by **CSA**, a top-secret research company. CSA employs robotic workers that frequently leave and re-enter the facility to gather external intelligence.

However, enemy spy robots are infiltrating the company by disguising themselves as employees. Your job is to **analyze their appearance, ID, timestamps, and reasons for visit** to determine who is legitimate and who is a threat.

### Gameplay

- **Level 1** – You are in a simulation, guided by senior AI assistants. This level teaches you how to properly check employees before granting them access.
- **Level 2** – You are now operating at the real security gate. Enemy spy robots will try to slip through. Mistakes now have **real consequences**. If you let a enemy robot in, CSA's critical research may be compromised.

The game combines **critical thinking**, **pattern recognition**, and **moral decision-making** while reinforcing awareness of how AI may shape the future.
